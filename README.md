### Eye gaze to cursor movement -

# Running the application:
* Dowload main.py and required-files.zip
* Extract the .zip folder and shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat should be in the same directory as main.py
* Open a terminal and run the command **python3 main.py** or **python main.py**

# Optimization:
* The algorithm used is a simple one that uses observations(made previously on the gaze-ratios) to move the cursors
* Help needed to optimise the movement of the cursor
